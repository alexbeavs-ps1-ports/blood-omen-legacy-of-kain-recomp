# Blood Omen: Legacy of Kain release feasibility

Status: `bootstrap_verified`; four-platform `v0.3.6` package pending exact-package gates

The operator confirmed that the promoted private build reaches gameplay. This
source-only pilot does not inherit that claim. It must pass the exact-package
setup, generation, build, and startup gates before it can claim
`bootstrap_verified`.

The owned NTSC-U revision is `SLUS-00027`. The boot executable SHA-256 is
`1f2a6037b8e1b022698a8e71b1ae796045571b99d119ed23114a25eacabe8c47`.
The project uses the corrected `0x801FFF00` stack value from the shared
SYSTEM.CNF ownership finding.

The public package must not contain the disc, a BIOS, generated retail code,
a save, a prebuilt title executable, or a private absolute path.

## v0.3.3 executable-name correction

Public `v0.3.0` can complete a build and then request the wrong executable.
The corrected source uses `Blood_Omen__Legacy_of_Kain_Recompiled` for CMake, the setup relaunch, and packaging.
The 24-title source parity gate passes. An exact-ZIP automatic-relaunch canary
must pass before release authorization.

## v0.3.5 three-platform refresh

The candidate targets Windows x64, Linux x64, macOS Apple Silicon ARM64, and
macOS Intel x64. The setup package uses an additive framework correction that
excludes two non-SDK helpers with developer-machine paths. Each exact package
must pass the payload, setup, startup, responsiveness, and clean-exit gates on
its declared platform before publication.

## 2026-09-03 portable Linux package

The release workflow now builds Linux in a pinned Ubuntu 20.04 container.
The package gate rejects a setup host or emitter that needs a glibc version
newer than 2.31. This keeps the release compatible with the qualified Rocky
Linux 9 host. Windows and both macOS builds keep their existing runners.

## 2026-09-04 v0.3.6 POSIX setup-copy candidate

This candidate pins PSXRecomp 08ec704a974b1f3a16335b4afeb340b9eff19926 and recomp-ui be8ac1d03ee19d55394b5a5f2d9d1506edd56659.
Linux and macOS packages use native CMake, Ninja, Python, C, and C++ tools.
Windows keeps the portable toolchain route. This change does not change game
code or the graduation state. Build-only CI and every exact-package release
gate must pass before publication.
